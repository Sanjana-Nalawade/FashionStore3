**INTRODUCTION**

**Online shopping** is the process of buying goods and services from merchants over the Internet. From a long time, merchants have sought to sell their products to people who spend time online. Shoppers can visit web stores from the comfort of their homes and shop as they sit in front of the computer.

Consumers can buy a huge variety of items from online stores, and just about anything can be purchased from companies that provide their products online. 

Our online shopping store deals with selling of clothes and apparels. Many people choose to shop online because of the convenience. A person only has to log onto the Internet, visit the store's website, and choose the items he/she desires. The items are held in a virtual shopping cart until she is ready to make her purchase. The shopper can remain in their pyjamas as he/she does their shopping, and the process can be conducted in the wee hours of the morning or late into the night. Online stores almost never close.
